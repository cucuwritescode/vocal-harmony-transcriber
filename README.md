# Vocal Harmony Transcriber (VHT)

## Motivation  
This project comes from my obsession with vocal harmony. Recently, I’ve been listening to the Everly Brothers and Guillaume de Machaut interchangeably, both transcribing their arrangements and recording them by ear.  

I thought it would be interesting to create a tool that could join me in that process. The goal is to have a computer assist in transcribing and notating two-part vocal harmonies, whether they’re 1960s close duets or medieval polyphony.

## What It Does  
**vocal-harmony-transcriber** is a Python tool that:  
- Takes two monophonic vocal tracks (lead & harmony) as input  
- Detects pitches, rhythms, and note boundaries in each  
- Aligns both parts to a beat grid  
- Outputs clean, editable notation as **MIDI** and **MusicXML**  

It’s designed for practical accuracy on clean recordings. Enough to produce a score you can immediately work with in MuseScore, Sibelius, Dorico, or Finale, and then refine by hand.

## Who It’s For  
- **Composers** exploring counterpoint, harmony, and texture  
- **Arrangers** transcribing vocal harmonies from recordings  
- **Music students** practicing ear training and transcription  
- **Researchers** studying stylistic differences in harmony  
- **Enthusiasts** who just love harmony (from Machaut to the Beach Boys)  

---

## Example Use Cases  
- **Everly Brothers**: extract close, country-influenced two-part harmony for study or arrangement.  
- **The Beatles / Beach Boys**: capture pop vocal arrangements to learn harmonic movement.  
- **de Machaut motets**: transcribe and analyse medieval double lines for contrapuntal study.  
- **Original compositions**: record your own lead + harmony parts and get instant notation.
